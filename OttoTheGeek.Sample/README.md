# OttoTheGeek.Sample

This is a working "hello world" GraphQL server and a testing harness so that you can use
this as a jumping-off point for experimenting with OttoTheGeek. This is organized as
a backend (a minimal ASP .Net Core app) and a frontend (based on `create-react-app`).

## Starting the Backend

Go to the `backend` folder and run `dotnet run`.

## Starting the Frontend

Go to the `frontend` folder and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.


## Using the Test Harness

The frontend project is built using GraphiQL, which is a well-known tool for exploring
a GraphQL endpoint. You can find documentation on using GraphiQL [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/running-queries-with-graphiql/).
